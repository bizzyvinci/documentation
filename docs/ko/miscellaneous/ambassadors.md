## 우리의 믿음

우리 팀은 Polkadot 생태계를 위한 유연하고 포괄적인 데이터 서비스의 기반 구축이라는 공통된 비전을 가지고 함께 해나가고 있습니다.

**개발자에 의한, 개발자를 위한 구축:** SubQuery는 개발자와 생태계의 빌더에게 최고의 제품 및 서비스 제공에 중점을 두고 성장하는 커뮤니티입니다. 서브쿼리는 폴카닷 생태계의 성패를 따르기 때문에 우리는 모든 일에서 고객을 염두에 두고 있습니다.

**Integrity and Accountability:** 우리팀은 오클랜드, 상하이, 그리고 시드니에 위치하고 있기 때문에 원격 업무수행이 중요합니다. 우리는 활력적, 자율적으로 협력해 목표를 달성하기를 기대합니다. 이를 위한 중요한 요건은 저희 팀이 그들의 행동에 책임을 지고 그들의 성실함을 유지하는 것입니다.

**Inclusive Guidance and Support:** 블록체인은 어렵고 누구나 때로는 도움을 필요로 합니다. 우리 커뮤니티에서 멍청한 질문이라는 건 없습니다. 저희 팀 모두는 저희 사용자를 서포트하기를 기대하고 있습니다. 저희는 저희의 서비스에 대한 가장 가치 있는 통찰력(그리고 저희가 그것을 어떻게 개선할 수 있는가) 을 커뮤니티로부터 직접 배웁니다.

## 앰배서더 프로그램

Our SubQuery Ambassador program aims to find community leaders passionate about Polkadot and SubQuery. We’re looking for self-starters that can spread the word about SubQuery in their local areas and provide support to new developers that want to use SubQuery to build amazing apps and services on Polkadot.

### 앰배서더 혜택

At SubQuery, we work hard to achieve what we do. Similarly, Ambassadors are expected to commit some time when joining our team but will be rewarded with benefits.

**Funding and Support:** You may be rewarded for good work with early opportunities into private sales and bounties. Additionally, we’ll be providing funding grants for you to run community meetups.

**SubQuery Team Access:** You’ll have direct access to the core SubQuery team with opportunities for hands-on training, exclusive AMAs with our leaders and developers, and insight into our roadmap.

**Network Development:** Expect to grow your professional network by being an Ambassador for one of the top Polkadot projects. Meet other ambassadors around the world and receive introductions to local Polkadot projects that we need to support locally. You might even get free entry to represent SubQuery in events in your local area.

**Swag and other free stuff:** Everyone likes free stuff! Receive an annual allocation of SubQuery swag that’ll make you stand out in the crowd. Plus additional allocation that you can share around at community events. You’ll also receive an exclusive NFT for your Ambassador status.

## How does it work

Our Ambassador program has multiple tiers, each tier has different benefits and capabilities. You can move up tiers by participating in Ambassador activities and working hard for us.

Once you have sent through an application, we will select candidates that align with our values. If selected you are placed in our trainee program and will receive an information package, expanding your understanding of SubQuery. After this, you can start to work through the trainee program by completing certain onboarding tasks (e.g. creating a SubQuery Project). We will host workshops throughout this process to support you.

Once you pass the trainee program, you can call yourself a SubQuery ambassador and will be accepted into our full program. From here on you can continue to work through the program and progress up the tiers, earning more rewards and benefits as you climb the ranks.

## 앰배서더 활동

SubQuery Ambassadors are able to contribute through four main areas, including event management, content creation, translation, and community moderation. You can participate in as many areas as you want, you’re not bound to any single one.

**Event Management:** Build local communities by hosting, organising, and managing different events. Building a local community will be a key part of growing the SubQuery community. SubQuery will support you by providing funding for events, sending swag/merchandise to be given away, as well as attending Q&As or online events as speakers or in AMA sessions.

**Content Creation:** We have a long list of content and support material that we need help creating. Remember, our success relies on the ability of our customers to build amazing things on our service, so we need your help to make that easier. Content includes videos, infographics, tutorials, animations, or any other related material, to inform, educate, or inspire community members within the SubQuery Ecosystem. SubQuery will support Content Creators by providing branding assets and expertise. We’ll also use SubQuery’s marketing channels to increase awareness of your content (and yourself).

**Translation:** Our customers don’t just speak English! We need your help making SubQuery more accessible by translating our content into your own language, as well as helping sharing the word to our international community.

**Community Moderation:** Moderators will help grow the SubQuery community by ensuring that official community channels are active and engaging. SubQuery will support Moderators by promoting the channels that they monitor, as well as provide guidelines for our expectations.
